### What Kubernetes is:
- Automating deployment
- Scaling
- Management
of containerized application.

### Question?
- How can I ensure that multiple instances of a piece of software are spread across multiple servers for high availability?
- How can I deploy new code changes and roll them out across the entire cluster?
- How can I create new containers to handle additional load (scale up)?

### Cluster Architecture

#### Kube master
- Docker
- Kubeadm: setting up kubernetes cluster quickly and easily
- Kubelet: node agent
- Kubectl: command line tool to interact with cluster
- Control Plane: allow kube master to control the clusters
